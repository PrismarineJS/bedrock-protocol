## Canâ€™t connect to localhost Win10 server with Minecraft Win10 Edition

This issue occurs due to loopback restrictions on Windows 10 UWP apps. To lift this restriction, launch Windows PowerShell as an administrator and run the following:

```ps
CheckNetIsolation LoopbackExempt -a -n="Microsoft.MinecraftUWP_8wekyb3d8bbwe"
```

If you are running a preview or beta release, you can run the following command to unlock that version:

```ps
CheckNetIsolation LoopbackExempt -a -n="Microsoft.MinecraftWindowsBeta"
```

If that still doesn't work, you can inspect what Minecraft versions are available on your system with:

```ps
Get-AppxPackage -AllUsers | Where Name -Match ".*Minecraft.*" | Select Name,InstallLocation,PackageFullName
```

Use the PackageFullName field in place of the `Microsoft.MinecraftUWP_8wekyb3d8bbwe` for the command above.

## Replit

## Kicked during login
NOTE: If you not receiving any errors, the error probably logged in debug mode which is not enabled. To enable it, set `process.env.DEBUG = 'minecraft-protocol'` to the top of the file

Some servers can kick you if you don't set `authTitle` as explained in the README. 

## Server clients kicked due to "jwt not active"

The system time is incorrect and needs to be corrected.
